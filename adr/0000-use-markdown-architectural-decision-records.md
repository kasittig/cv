# Use Markdown Architectural Decision Records

## Context and Problem Statement

I believe strongly in recording a project's architectural and design decisions, regardless of the scope of the project. I find that intentionally recording these decisions supports me in fully considering my options. I also find that it's quite helpful to have a record of architectural decisions made when showing my projects to others.

This ADR answers: what format and structure should the records in this project follow?

## Considered Options

* [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) 4.0.0 – The Markdown Architectural Decision Records
* [Michael Nygard's template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) – The first incarnation of the term "ADR"
* [Sustainable Architectural Decisions](https://www.infoq.com/articles/sustainable-architectural-design-decisions) – The Y-Statements
* Other templates listed at <https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record>
* Formless – No conventions for file format and structure

This list was copied from [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/).

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: MADR 4.0.0, because

* I find the format lightweight and easy to use.
* I like the recommendations and advice in the [ADR Github Organization](https://adr.github.io/), and this is their preferred format.
* The MADR project is well maintained, and I expect it will continue to be well maintained in the future.
